Here, you will get the details about how to build the app (in recommended way).

Note: This docs file assume that, you are build the project without android studio and with the `installondevice.bat` script provided.

## Prerequisites

You will need `gradle` and `adb` accessible from command-line so, that script can do its job.

```powershell
adb --version
```

and

```powershell
cd passcodes
./gradlew --version
```

Something like this...

```powershell
PS D:\####\####\passcodes> adb --version
Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41
Version 35.0.2-12147458
Installed as D:\####\####\lib\platform-tools\adb.exe
Running on Windows 10.0.26100

PS D:\####\####\passcodes> ./gradlew --version

## Preparing For A Build.

Here, are the things you required, first you will need a `keystore.properties` & `passcodes.jks` in project root. So, that the script can be able to sign the apk file when generated. Second thing you might need is a mobile device with USB debugging enable, connected to your machine, because script install the app directly using `adb`.

### Template For `keystore.properties`

```
keyAlias=passcodes
keyPassword=
storeFile=./../passcodes.jks
storePassword=
```

**Fill the `keyPassword` and `storePassword`** and you are good to go.

## Deprecated: Finial Run Script For Building
