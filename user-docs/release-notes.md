`TL;DR`: Design Improvement.. | Will work with google passwords.... | We are officially an organization on GitHub from `Aug 31, 2025`.... 

This our first **officially release after migrating to the github organization...** this release has feature like import & export passwords from google passwords app... this is also a alpha release and both features (copy password & import export password) are disable by default due to security threats... they can be turn on if you wish...

Also as the passcodes have change from just my personal hobby project to official organization.. this release is step for us to move to open source and open to contribute... and more importantly it reflect, my long term vision with passcodes as a project... what it means? upcoming things will be more fascinating to view and to be part of... and also the app will have more long term support... (if you ignore, the fact that I am not verified developer as of "1/9/25 by google"... but will do it in near time...)

Organization is name **PasscodesApp and not Passcodes. Because, it not available on github.......**

Stick to watch and observe passcodes upcoming progress... [Telegram](https://t.me/passcodescommunity)

`TL;DR`: Our first stable release.. | Not much has change in terms of look and feature.. | Name of project has changed to "Passcodes"..

This is our first stable release, even though it look and behave same as prototype release.
it now more stable and more reliable as the data storage part is now tested and optimized and uses more modern approach (room library)..
things have change internally also... like app was first build using java.. but, now it is build using Kotlin.
now, you can also switch theme and languages in app..
also improve UI/UX by providing help text.. especially as you all have question like "what is domain?" "what can i write in domain?" and so on.....


## v0.1.0-Alpha (Aug 26, 2024)

```
Package Name = "com.passwordmanager"
Min Android = 8.0 (API level 26)
Max Android = 13 (API level 33)
Version Code = 1
Version Name = "0.1.0-Alpha"
Master Database Version = "v1"
```


`TL;DR`: Our first initial release.. | Prototype release..

It a prototype release which mean it can have bugs...
It has all core features, like create, read, update and delete passwords...
It has basic UI that allow you do do things, really intuitively and more structure...
But structure and intuitively doesn't necessary means modern UI... UI is now so cool but has structure...
