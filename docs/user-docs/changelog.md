### Breaking Changes

- **Migrate to DataStore**: changed the way how setting and feature flag were been storage
  previously, we use shared preferences but
  now we use datastore which will be more modern way to store such data... but this will also mean
  that your previous setting will be
  not available anymore. we have decide this break changes, because app settings can be restored
  again (in like few minutes). [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38)

### Added

#### Preview Features

- **Autofill System (Preview Feature)**: added a autofill service to autofill user's credentials on
  the fly. [@hexCode63](https://github.com/hexCode63)

- **Jetpack Compose (Preview Feature)**: added jetpack compose UI & even added a toggle to switch to
  this new UI.
  but it would be worthless to do so, because it just has a single screen.. *this feature is mainly
  for very earlier testing*. [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38)

### Changed

- **MVI Flavored - Clean Architecture**: migrated the codebase to make it more scalable,
  extendable & readable.
  This will enable us to create better features faster & make a strong base for faster
  iteration. [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38)

- **Java 21**: migrated the code for passcodes app now compile to java 21. previously it was 
  compiling to java 11. This should improve performance & efficiency a bit. [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38)

- **Improved Performance**: Improve performance & better responsiveness of UI (less of density
  pixel, more of scalable pixel measurements). [@JeelDobariya38](https://github.com/JeelDobariya38)
