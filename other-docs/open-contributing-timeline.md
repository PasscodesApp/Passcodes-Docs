### Semi Open To Contribute (start of jan 2026)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Organisation is from this point, open to receive any contribution from any potential contributors.. 
> 
> The reason, it is not fully open to contributing is solely because of this developer verification thing... the thing is I don't want anyone to waste there time contributing to this repository.. because, I might end up not make verification due to some or other reason... and this might result in waste of other developer waste of there valuable time.. because without verification the application might not be release as google wouldn't allow it to install on android devices....
> 
> Other then this, or If this thing doesn't impact you in anyway then you count the repository as fuly open to contribute but just have note of it..
