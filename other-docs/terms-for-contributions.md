## Casual Explanation

I know, all of above writing stuff, look super professional and to a some level super rude too.. but, I just want to be very clear with contributor from early on that this might be a thing in future... so, that no one's intrested and work is waste and at end of day every one feel safe to contribute with clear idea of what they can expect... 

I have recently, think that I am get a great response for my project... (thank you for that ðŸ’œ) atleast the response I get utill on telegram community is far high, then what I expected in earlier days... I initially wasn't expecting this much, I was expecting passcodes as my own hobby project... but I turn out to be super good.. So, I am deciding or planning towards monetize this project in future... so, I just wanna to be clear with contributors, about it... as earlier as possible..

Note that, By no means, what write above is a legal document. It just a claim or document write by me... and what I write above is, is something I think (utill my knowledge). is always being a silent, unsaid rule in open source. but, I just want to be clear. and I hope you all will  accepted it and pretend like it a legal document and follow it... ðŸ˜‚ 

For any questions or doubt, you reach out to me directly on telegram community... (https://t.me/passcodescommunity)
