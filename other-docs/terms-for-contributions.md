## Casual Explanation

I know, all above write stuff look super professional and to some level super rude too.. but, I just want to be very clear with contributor from early on that this might be a thing in future... so, that no one intrested and work is waste and at end of day every one feel safe to contribute with clear idea of what they can expect... 

I have recently, think that I am get a great response for my project... (thank you for that) atleast the response I get utill on telegram is far high, then what I expected... i initially wasn't expecting this much i was expecting passcodes as hobby project... So, I am decided or planning towards monetize this project in future... so i just wanna to be clear with contributors about it...

By no mean what write above is a legal document. It just a claim or document write by me... and what write about is, I think (utill my knowledge). it always a silent, unsaid rule in open source. but, i just want to be clear. and I hope you all be accepted it and pretend like it a legal document and follow it...

For any questions or doubt, you reach out to me directly on telegram community... https://t.me/passcodescommunity.
