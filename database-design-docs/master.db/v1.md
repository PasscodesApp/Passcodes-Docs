### Setup SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `passwords` (
	`id` INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, 
	`domain` TEXT NOT NULL,
	`username` TEXT NOT NULL, 
	`password` TEXT NOT NULL,
	`notes` TEXT NOT NULL, 
	`created_at` TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 
	`updated_at` TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

## Migration SQL (v0 -> v1)

```sql
---
```

## Revert SQL (v0 <- v1)

```sql
DROP TABLE `passwords`;
```

## Changes Made

**IMPORTANT**:- Changes were not made to previous database schema. But, an **entirely a new database schema** was builded from ground up..

You still will see similarity with previous schema (v0) as this schema (v1) is builded inspired by that schema.

Key Changes:- 

- Now, all field are `TEXT` instead of `VARCHAR` & `DATE`
- `notes` field is now, not nullable from v1. To stay consistent with other fields.
- `createdat` & `updatedat` field is now `created_at` & `updated_at` respectively.
