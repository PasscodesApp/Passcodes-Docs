> [!NOTE]

## Tips & Recommendation

We recommend using / opening, this docs in [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) for better experience in navigating as It made in obsidian app..

if you thing you gonna use it a lot otherwise in GitHub in browser is fine as well.

## Best Practices We Follow

- Use lowercase character for docs file / directory name.
- Use hyphens for docs file / directory name.
- Also try to separate and organize docs as much as possible.. like a hierarchy. (don't fear nested structure).
- Avoid rename file once created because there might URL point to it... from app and various source which once publish can;t change.. (but if you have a strong reason break this rule).
