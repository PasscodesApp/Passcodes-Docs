# Passcodes-Docs

This repository contains Developers Docs, Support Docs & User Guide For Passcodes App.

> [!NOTE]
> The [docs (at repositiory)](https://github.com/PasscodesApp/Passcodes-Docs/) might have outdated (behind time) or forward (ahead of time) info (may be by a week).. 
> So, it always good to verify stuff.. By see the code... Because we as developer of passcodes focus more on code.. and documenation is our second priority..

## Documentaion Version System

<!-- Currently, docs is general to all app. and no version system is needed

We have version system for docs, every version of app will have a coressponding docs, that you will find from below table.
We use git(&hub) tags to seperate docs.. And this make up a version system for docs.

| App Version                   | Docs URL                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| latest (development use only) | https://github.com/PasscodesApp/Passcodes-Docs
| vX.X.X                        | https://github.com/PasscodesApp/Passcodes-Docs/blob/vX.X.X     |
| all prior version             | https://github.com/PasscodesApp/Passcodes-Docs/blob/prior-docs |

-->

All the version of the app, can use the documenation avaliable over here, it is same for all docs.. [prior-docs](/blob/prior-docs).
The docs avaliable here, in this repository are [under development](https://github.com/PasscodesApp/Passcodes-Docs/).

## Tips & Recommendation

We recommend using / opening, this docs in [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) for better experience in navigating as It made in obsidian app..

if you thing you gonna use it a lot otherwise in GitHub in browser is fine as well.

## Best Practices We Follow

- Use lowercase character for docs file / directory name.
- Use hyphens for docs file / directory name.
- Also try to separate and organize docs as much as possible.. like a hierarchy. (don't fear nested structure).
- Avoid rename file once created because there might URL point to it... from app and various source which once publish can;t change.. (but if you have a strong reason break this rule).
